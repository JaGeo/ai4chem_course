# Preface {.unnumbered}

## AI 4 Chem course book

The Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Chemistry course will be taught in Spring 2023. It is a course with a lot of hands-on exercises. Experience in Python programming and machine learning (ML) will help you to get up to speed quickly, but we will try to make it as accessible as possible. 

We will make use of [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) to run the code directly in your browser, as there is zero configuration required and we will have access to GPUs free of charge.

A lot of the examples and ideas in this course are taken from the open-source community, which we will properly reference.

Check them out and don't forget to leave a star on GitHub and follow the authors on Twitter, if you like the content. 
Those blogs and webpages have all helped me during the creation of this course (and also before, when I was learning about ML for Chemistry).
