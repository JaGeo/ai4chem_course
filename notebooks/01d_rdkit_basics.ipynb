    "## RDKit\n",
    "`RDKit` is an open-source software toolkit for cheminformatics, designed to assist in the analysis and design of small molecules and chemical compounds. It provides a set of libraries and tools for the manipulation and analysis of molecular structures, molecular descriptors, molecular fingerprints, molecular similarity, molecular visualization, and more. The toolkit is widely used in academia, as well as in the pharmaceutical, biotech, and chemical industries for a variety of tasks such as virtual screening, lead optimization, and chemical database management.\n",

    "The name `caffeine` does not contain any structural information on the molecule. Just by having this name a computer does not know how many (heavy) atoms `caffeine` contains and what bonds they form. We need machine-accessible representations. One of the most commonly used ones is `SMILES`.\n",

    "## SMILES\n",
    "\n",
    "`SMILES` (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) is a line notation representation of molecular structures. It is a way of representing chemical compounds as strings of characters, which can be easily processed and analyzed by computer algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each SMILES string consists of symbols that represent the elements in the molecule, as well as brackets and other characters that describe the bonding between the atoms. For example, the SMILES string for ethanol (C2H5OH) would be `CCO`. In SMILES, each carbon atom is represented by the letter \"C\", each hydrogen atom by the letter \"H\", and each oxygen atom by the letter \"O\". The bonding between the atoms is indicated by the arrangement of the characters in the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "SMILES is widely used in cheminformatics and computational chemistry, as it provides a compact and standardized way of representing molecular structures in a machine-readable form. This makes it possible to compare and analyze large numbers of chemical compounds, as well as to generate predictions about their properties and behavior.\n",
