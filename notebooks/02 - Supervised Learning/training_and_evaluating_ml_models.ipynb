    "### Scikit-learn\n",
    "Scikit-learn is an open source machine learning library that supports supervised and unsupervised learning. It also provides various tools for model fitting, data preprocessing, model selection, model evaluation, and many other utilities. It is widely used in industry and academia, and a wealth of tutorials and code snippets are available online.\n",
    "We will learn to use scikit-learn to do machine learning work. You can also browse the scikit-learn [user guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html) and [tutorials](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/index.html) for additional details.\n",
    "### Essential Libraries and Tools \n",
    "Scikit-learn depends on two other Python packages, NumPy and SciPy. For plotting and interactive development, you should also install matplotlib, IPython, and the Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "- **NumPy** is one of the fundamental packages for scientific computing in Python. It contains functionality for multidimensional arrays, high-level mathematical functions such as linear algebra operations and the Fourier transform, and pseudorandom number generators. In scikit-learn, the NumPy array is the fundamental data structure. scikit-learn takes in data in the form of NumPy arrays. Any data you’re using will have to be con‐ verted to a NumPy array.\n",
    "- **SciPy** is a collection of functions for scientific computing in Python. It provides, among other functionality, advanced linear algebra routines, mathematical function optimization, signal processing, special mathematical functions, and statistical distributions. scikit-learn draws from SciPy’s collection of functions for implementing its algorithms.\n",
    "- **Matplotlib** is the primary scientific plotting library in Python. It provides functions for making publication-quality visualizations such as line charts, histograms, scatter plots, and so on.\n",
    "- **Pandas** Python library for data wrangling and analysis. It is built around a data structure called the DataFrame that is similar to an Excel spreadsheet. It can ingest from a great variety of file formats and databases, like SQL, Excel files, and comma-separated values (CSV) files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### XGBoost\n",
    "XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible and portable. It implements machine learning algorithms under the Gradient Boosting framework. XGBoost provides a parallel tree boosting (also known as GBDT, GBM) that solve many data science problems in a fast and accurate way. You can also browse the [XGBoost Documentation](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for additional details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### DeepChem\n",
    "DeepChem is a high quality open-source toolchain that democratizes the use of deep-learning in chemistry, biology and materials science. It also provides various tools for dataset loader, splitters, molecular featurization, model construction and hyperparameter tuning. You can also browse the [DeepChem Ducumentation](https://deepchem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for additional details."

    "# 1. Introduction to Machine learning\n",
    "Machine learning (ML) is a field of inquiry devoted to understanding and building methods that \"learn\" – that is, methods that leverage data to improve performance on some set of tasks. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.\n",

    "Machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories, depending on the nature of the \"signal\" or \"feedback\" available to the learning system:\n",
    "- **Supervised learning**: The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a \"teacher\", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs.\n",
    "- **Unsupervised learning**: No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end (feature learning).\n",
    "- **Reinforcement learning**: A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent). As it navigates its problem space, the program is provided feedback that's analogous to rewards, which it tries to maximize.\n",
