    "### Scikit-learn\n",
    "Scikit-learn is an open source machine learning library that supports supervised and unsupervised learning. It also provides various tools for model fitting, data preprocessing, model selection, model evaluation, and many other utilities. It is widely used in industry and academia, and a wealth of tutorials and code snippets are available online.\n",
    "We will learn to use scikit-learn to do machine learning work. You can also browse the scikit-learn [user guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html) and [tutorials](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/index.html) for additional details.\n",
    "### Essential Libraries and Tools \n",
    "Scikit-learn depends on two other Python packages, NumPy and SciPy. For plotting and interactive development, you should also install matplotlib, IPython, and the Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "- **NumPy** is one of the fundamental packages for scientific computing in Python. It contains functionality for multidimensional arrays, high-level mathematical functions such as linear algebra operations and the Fourier transform, and pseudorandom number generators. In scikit-learn, the NumPy array is the fundamental data structure. scikit-learn takes in data in the form of NumPy arrays. Any data you‚Äôre using will have to be con‚Äê verted to a NumPy array.\n",
    "- **SciPy** is a collection of functions for scientific computing in Python. It provides, among other functionality, advanced linear algebra routines, mathematical function optimization, signal processing, special mathematical functions, and statistical distributions. scikit-learn draws from SciPy‚Äôs collection of functions for implementing its algorithms.\n",
    "- **Matplotlib** is the primary scientific plotting library in Python. It provides functions for making publication-quality visualizations such as line charts, histograms, scatter plots, and so on.\n",
    "- **Pandas** Python library for data wrangling and analysis. It is built around a data structure called the DataFrame that is similar to an Excel spreadsheet. It can ingest from a great variety of file formats and databases, like SQL, Excel files, and comma-separated values (CSV) files."
