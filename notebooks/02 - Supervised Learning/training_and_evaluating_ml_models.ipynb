    "### Scikit-learn\n",
    "Scikit-learn is an open source machine learning library that supports supervised and unsupervised learning. It also provides various tools for model fitting, data preprocessing, model selection, model evaluation, and many other utilities. We will learn to use scikit-learn to do machine learning work. You can also browse the scikit-learn [user guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html) and [tutorials](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/index.html) for additional details.\n",
    "### Essential Libraries and Tools \n",
    "Scikit-learn depends on two other Python packages, NumPy and SciPy. For plotting and interactive development, you should also install matplotlib, IPython, and the Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "- **NumPy** is one of the fundamental packages for scientific computing in Python. In scikit-learn, the NumPy array is the fundamental data structure. Any data you’re using will have to be converted to a NumPy array.\n",
    "- **SciPy** is a collection of functions for scientific computing in Python. Scikit-learn draws from SciPy’s collection of functions for implementing its algorithms.\n",
    "- **Matplotlib** is the primary scientific plotting library in Python. It provides functions for making publication-quality visualizations such as line charts, histograms, scatter plots, and so on.\n",
    "- **Pandas** Python library for data wrangling and analysis. It can ingest from a great variety of file formats and databases, like SQL, Excel files, and comma-separated values (CSV) files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### XGBoost\n",
    "XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible and portable. It implements machine learning algorithms under the Gradient Boosting framework. XGBoost provides a parallel tree boosting (also known as GBDT, GBM) that solve many data science problems in a fast and accurate way. You can also browse the [XGBoost Documentation](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for additional details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### DeepChem\n",
    "DeepChem is a high quality open-source toolchain that democratizes the use of deep-learning in chemistry, biology and materials science. It also provides various tools for dataset loader, splitters, molecular featurization, model construction and hyperparameter tuning. You can also browse the [DeepChem Ducumentation](https://deepchem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for additional details."

    "We want models learn from data to predict on new data, but we cannot use the data we used to build the model to evaluate it. Hence, you need to separate your input data into `training`, `validation`, and `test` subsets to prevent your model from overfitting and to evaluate your model effectively. If you have more time, you can read this [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-split-data-into-three-sets-train-validation-and-test-and-why-e50d22d3e54c) for more details.\n",
